                <p>
                    The words below were written three years ago. i was wrestling with New Year’s at the time,
                    struggling but also fascinated by the attention given to a moment. One year ends and the next
                    begins, and we grow up with the understanding that it’s cause for celebration. There are parties and
                    television specials, but i couldn’t keep from thinking that maybe there was more. Questions worth
                    asking, ideas worth unpacking. Welcome to Midnight has become a conversation we’ve circled back to
                    every year since.

                <h1>Our Awesome Portfolio</h1>
                <p>We all have that one person in life who stymies all of our gift-giving efforts, either by buying
                    whatever they need or by claiming they don’t want anything. We firmly believe there is a gift for
                    everyone—even those who are hard to please. So we’ve gathered a collection of things that span the
                    tough-to-shop-for gamut, including the pretty, the useful, the clever, the luxurious, and, of
                    course, the edible. And if your loved one is truly a shunner of stuff, we’ve included a gift that
                    allows them to give back without coming into contact with material goods.</p>
