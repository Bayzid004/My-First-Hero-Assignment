                    The words below were written three years ago. i was wrestling with New Year’s at the time, struggling but also fascinated by the attention given to a moment. One year ends and the next begins, and we grow up with the understanding that it’s cause for celebration. There are parties and television specials, but i couldn’t keep from thinking that maybe there was more. Questions worth asking, ideas worth unpacking. Welcome to Midnight has become a conversation we’ve circled back to every year since.
